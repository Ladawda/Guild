## Fallback Strategy

If all crew variants are taken:

**Go with Squad**
- Same team/community vibe
- squad.pro likely available
- "Join the squad" works too
- Slightly more modern feel

Or **Team**
- team.pro
- Universal, everyone understands
- Boring but bulletproof

---

## My Pick: **getcrew.com** or **crew.pro**

**getcrew.com** if you want classic SaaS
**crew.pro** if you want short and professional

Both keep "crew" as the brand name, which is what matters most.
