# Guild - Brand Guidelines

## Brand Name
**Guild** — Where clients and contractors unite.

## Domain
**joinguild.app**

## The Concept

Inspired by anime guilds — a place where:
- **Quests** are posted (jobs)
- **Adventurers** apply (contractors)
- **Parties** are formed (matches)
- **Quests are completed** (jobs done)

Everyone has a role. Everyone contributes. No middleman.

---

## Voice & Tone

### Guild Voice
- **Direct:** No fluff, no corporate speak
- **Inclusive:** Everyone's part of the guild
- **Empowering:** You control your work
- **Playful (subtle):** Anime/gaming references without being childish

### Tone Examples

**Instead of:** "We facilitate connections between service providers and consumers"
**Say:** "Post a quest. Find your party. Get it done."

**Instead of:** "Our platform enables seamless transactions"
**Say:** "No middleman. No BS. Just you and the work."

**Instead of:** "Contractor marketplace"
**Say:** "The guild for people who build things"

## Naming Conventions in Code/DB

**Database tables:**
- `quests` (not jobs)
- `adventurers` or `contractors` (not service_providers)
- `quest_givers` or `clients`
- `parties` or `matches`
- `guild_memberships` (subscriptions)

**API endpoints:**
- `/api/quests` (not /api/jobs)
- `/api/quests/:id/apply` (apply to quest)
- `/api/adventurers` (contractor profiles)

**Internal consistency:** Pick one set and stick to it.
