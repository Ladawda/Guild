## Subheadline

**For quest givers:**
Post your quest once. Get connected with verified adventurers who are actually available and interested. No spam, no unlicensed workers, no endless phone tag.

**For adventurers:**
Browse real quests from serious quest givers. No lead fees. No competing with 20 other adventurers. Just you, your skills, and people who need them.

## Problem Statement

### The Old Way Doesn't Work

**For Quest Givers:**
- Post on [Big Platform] → Get 50 calls from unqualified workers
- Ask friends → They used someone 3 years ago who might be retired
- Google "contractor near me" → Hope for the best
- Result: Wasted time, questionable quality, no peace of mind

**For Adventurers:**
- Pay $50/lead on [Big Platform] → Compete with 15 other adventurers
- Hope someone sees your website → They don't
- Rely on word-of-mouth → Inconsistent
- Result: Expensive leads, low close rates, feast-or-famine income

## Solution Explanation

## The Guild Fixes Both Sides

**We verify every adventurer by hand.**
Real humans check licenses, confirm insurance, review past work. No shortcuts.

**We limit competition.**
Adventurers see your quest. They apply. You get 2-3 qualified options, not 50 random calls.

**We form your party, then get out of the way.**
No forced messaging apps. No platform fees on your quest. Just a warm intro to someone qualified, then you work directly.

## How It Works (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Post Your Quest (2 Minutes)
Tell us what you need, where you are, and when. No phone number required until you're ready.

### Step 2: Form Your Party (24-48 Hours)
Verified adventurers in your area review your quest. Interested? We check them out first.

### Step 3: Complete the Quest
We email you both. You talk. You decide. No middleman, no markup, no app to download.

## FAQ (5 Questions)

### How do you verify adventurers?

We manually check every adventurer's license against state contractor board databases. We confirm insurance is current. We review photos of past work. It takes us 10 minutes, but it saves you hours of worry.

### What if I don't like the adventurers matched?

No problem. You're never obligated to hire anyone. If the party formation isn't right, just let us know and we'll try to find better options. Or walk away—no hard feelings.

### How do adventurers get paid?

However you both agree. Cash, check, Venmo, bank transfer—whatever works for you. We don't handle payments and we don't take a cut. We just form the party.

### What cities do you serve?

Right now we're focused on **[YOUR CITY]**. We're starting small to ensure quality. If you're nearby, sign up anyway—we'll expand soon.

### What if something goes wrong with the quest?

We verify adventurers, but we don't guarantee their work. That's between you and them. We do track outcomes and remove adventurers who get consistent complaints. Always check references and get everything in writing.
