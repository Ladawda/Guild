## Problem Statement

### The Old Way Doesn't Work

**For Homeowners:**
- Post on [Big Platform] → Get 50 calls from unqualified workers
- Ask friends → They used someone 3 years ago who might be retired
- Google "contractor near me" → Hope for the best
- Result: Wasted time, questionable quality, no peace of mind

**For Contractors:**
- Pay $50/lead on [Big Platform] → Compete with 15 other contractors
- Hope someone sees your website → They don't
- Rely on word-of-mouth → Inconsistent
- Result: Expensive leads, low close rates, feast-or-famine income

## Solution Explanation

## Contractie Fixes Both Sides

**We verify every contractor by hand.**
Real humans check licenses, confirm insurance, review past work. No shortcuts.

**We limit competition.**
Contractors see your job. They express interest. You get 2-3 qualified options, not 50 random calls.

**We make introductions, then get out of the way.**
No forced messaging apps. No platform fees on your project. Just a warm intro to someone qualified, then you work directly.

## FAQ (5 Questions)

### How do you verify contractors?

We manually check every contractor's license against state contractor board databases. We confirm insurance is current. We review photos of past work. It takes us 10 minutes, but it saves you hours of worry.

### What if I don't like the contractors matched?

No problem. You're never obligated to hire anyone. If the match isn't right, just let us know and we'll try to find better options. Or walk away—no hard feelings.

### How do contractors get paid?

However you both agree. Cash, check, Venmo, bank transfer—whatever works for you. We don't handle payments and we don't take a cut. We just make the introduction.

### What cities do you serve?

Right now we're focused on **[YOUR CITY]**. We're starting small to ensure quality. If you're nearby, sign up anyway—we'll expand soon.

### What if something goes wrong with the project?

We verify contractors, but we don't guarantee their work. That's between you and them. We do track outcomes and remove contractors who get consistent complaints. Always check references and get everything in writing.
