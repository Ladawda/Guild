# Marketing Strategy

## Go-to-Market Plan for Contractie

This is a lean, scrappy launch plan designed to get your first 10 contractors and 10 homeowners with minimal budget.

---

## Target Market

### Start With ONE City

**Why one city?**
- Focus your limited time
- Build density (contractors see jobs, homeowners see contractors)
- Word-of-mouth works better
- Easier to dominate a niche

**How to choose:**
1. Where do you live? (Easier to verify contractors, understand market)
2. Mid-size city (100k-500k population)
3. Active construction/remodeling market
4. You have some existing connections

**Recommended starter cities:**
- Austin, TX
- Nashville, TN
- Raleigh, NC
- Phoenix, AZ
- Tampa, FL

**If you don't live there:** Pick where you live or where you have family/friends who can help.
