### Problem Section
```
## The Old Way Sucks

❌ Pay $50-100 per lead
❌ Lead shared with 5 competitors  
❌ 20% commission on every job
❌ Race to bottom on pricing
❌ Middleman controls communication

Contractors: You're not a revenue stream.
Clients: You're not a cash cow.
```

### Solution Section
```
## The Contractie Way

✅ Clients: $10 flat (FREE first month)

✅ Direct connection — talk immediately
✅ You set your rates
✅ You keep 100% of earnings

We don't sell leads.
We don't take cuts.
We just connect.
```

### How It Works
```
## Simple as 1-2-3

1. **Post** — Client posts job (FREE launch month)
2. **Connect** — Contractor expresses interest ($25/month unlimited)

That's it. No hidden fees. No surprises.
