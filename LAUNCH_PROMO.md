### Problem Section
```
## The Old Way Sucks

❌ Pay $50-100 per lead
❌ Lead shared with 5 competitors  
❌ 20% commission on every job
❌ Race to bottom on pricing
❌ Middleman controls communication

Adventurers: You're not a revenue stream.
Quest Givers: You're not a cash cow.
```

### Solution Section
```
## The Guild Way

✅ Quest Givers: $10 flat (FREE first month)

✅ Direct party formation — talk immediately
✅ You set your rates

### How It Works
```
## Simple as 1-2-3

1. **Post** — Quest giver posts a quest (FREE launch month)
2. **Apply** — Adventurer applies to join the party ($25/month unlimited)

That's it. No hidden fees. No surprises.
